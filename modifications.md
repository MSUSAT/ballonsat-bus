# Version 0.1

Consider what we have designed and gotten manufactured as of 2022-04-20 to be Version 0.1.

# Version 0.2

The following is a list of modifications to do per board for Version 0.2 to be ordered on Monday, 2022-04-25. All of these will be converted to issues. Also, the boards will be split up into separate repositories.

## Sensors
1. The PIC programmer pins:
   1. Should be at 90 degrees toward the outside.
   2. Their ends should be [supporting rail width] mm in from the side of the board.
   3. Their height (from board to 90-deg bend) has to be either 5.32 mm or 3.19 mm. These are the 
   4. Their depth (horizontal part after the 90-deg bend) should be sufficient for the femail connector of the PIC programmer (~ 6 mm).
   5. There should not be any other components in the way of the PIC programmer on both sides of the pins for a total width of 39.72 mm.

## CDH

## EPS
1. Same as (1) for [sensors](#sensors).
2. 

## Battery pack

## Miscellaneous
1. The combined height of the bottom-board backplane connector and the mid-board backplane connector (plastic parts, when flush against both boards) is perfect to let the PIC programmer in. The height/thickness of PIC connector is 10.87 mm.
