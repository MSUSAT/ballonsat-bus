# EPS Notes

Current poorly implemented and understood version controls:
  
     -Let team know you are going to work on the kicad files
  
     -Clone latest repository
  
     -Work on files from the cloned repository on your local computer
  
     -Commit files with short description of your changes to your branch (fork?)
  
     -Notify Dan, he will merge with main branch
    
  Questions:
  
      -How will we use shared libraries without it being a pain in the ass
